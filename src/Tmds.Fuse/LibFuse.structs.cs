        *    filtered out / handled by the kernel.
        *
        *  - Access modes (O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR) should be used
        *    by the filesystem to check if the operation is
        *    permitted.  If the ``-o default_permissions`` mount
        *    option is given, this check is already done by the
        *    kernel before calling open() and may thus be omitted by
        *    the filesystem.
        *
        *  - When writeback caching is enabled, the kernel may send
        *    read requests even for files opened with O_WRONLY. The
        *    filesystem should be prepared to handle this.
        *
        *  - When writeback caching is disabled, the filesystem is
        *    expected to properly handle the O_APPEND flag and ensure
        *    that each write is appending to the end of the file.
        * 
            *  - When writeback caching is enabled, the kernel will
        *    handle O_APPEND. However, unless all changes to the file
        *    come through the kernel this will not work reliably. The
        *    filesystem should thus either ignore the O_APPEND flag
        *    (and let the kernel handle it), or return an error
        *    (indicating that reliably O_APPEND is not available).
        *
        * Filesystem may store an arbitrary file handle (pointer,
        * index, etc) in fi->fh, and use this in other all other file
        * operations (read, write, flush, release, fsync).
        *
        * Filesystem may also implement stateless file I/O and not store
        * anything in fi->fh.
        *
        * There are also some flags (direct_io, keep_cache) which the
        * filesystem may set in fi, to change the way the file is opened.
        * See fuse_file_info structure in <fuse_common.h> for more details.
